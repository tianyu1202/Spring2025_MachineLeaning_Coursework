# Spring2025_MachineLeaning_Coursework

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook lab assignments from a Machine Learning course. The labs range from exploratory data analysis to linear regression methods and deep learning models.

## Lab Overview

### Lab 1: Exploratory Analysis on Airbnb Data
- Dataset: NYC Airbnb (10k entries)
- Tasks:
  - Histogram & scatter plot of numerical features
  - Correlation matrix visualization
  - Linear model to predict price
  - RSS cost function implementation
- Tools: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Lab 2: Linear Regression Methods
- Part 1: Bootstrapping confidence intervals for linear model coefficients  
- Part 2: Ridge and Lasso regression on MRI Slices dataset  
- Bonus: Elastic Net regression
- Tools: `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`

### Lab 3: Deep Learning with MNIST
- Model: Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Techniques:
  - Learning rate finder
  - Checkpoints, early stopping
  - TensorBoard visualization
- Goal: Achieve >98% accuracy
- Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`
