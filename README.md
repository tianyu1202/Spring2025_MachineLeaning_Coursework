# Spring2025_MachineLeaning_Coursework

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook lab assignments from a Machine Learning course. The labs range from exploratory data analysis to linear regression methods and deep learning models.

## Lab Overview

### Lab 1: Exploratory Analysis on Airbnb Data
- Dataset: NYC Airbnb (10k entries)
- Tasks:
  - Histogram & scatter plot of numerical features
  - Correlation matrix visualization
  - Linear model to predict price
  - RSS cost function implementation
- Tools: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Lab 2: Linear Regression Methods
- Part 1: Bootstrapping confidence intervals for linear model coefficients  
- Part 2: Ridge and Lasso regression on MRI Slices dataset  
- Bonus: Elastic Net regression
- Tools: `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`

### Lab 3: Deep Learning with MNIST
- Model: Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Techniques:
  - Learning rate finder
  - Checkpoints, early stopping
  - TensorBoard visualization
- Goal: Achieve >98% accuracy
- Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`

### Lab 4: Recurrent Neural Networks â€“ Word-level Text Generation

- Objective: Build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate Shakespeare-style text using word-level encoding.
- Tasks:
  - Preprocess Shakespeare text data by removing punctuation and filtering rare words
  - Train RNN models using both LSTM and GRU layers
  - Generate sentences using each model
  - Compare performance and output quality of LSTM vs GRU
- Key Points:
  - Shift from character-level to word-level modeling
  - Vocabulary filtering to reduce sparsity
  - Use of `Tokenizer`, `Embedding`, `LSTM` / `GRU`, and text sampling
- Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `NLTK` / `re`
